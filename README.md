# MS-Translator-For-Qud-Transcription
stylus custom style that makes the ms translator room look better for live caption use. Qud edition!

Stuff I changed:
- made the dialogue look more Quddy (white outline, scanlines)
- made the background a green for chroma key
- narrowed the width to better fit stream layouts
- auto shrink the message bubble for small messages instead of being fixed width all the time
- hid avatars and conversation bot messages in a very janky way

# Instructions:

Install Stylus on your browser of choice. press Import and import the json. make a room in translator.microsoft.com/chatroom (make sure night mode is on!)
